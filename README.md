Set up the React Native environment on your machine
### Step 2: Go through React Native Tutorials
Go through React Native Tutorials and build a basic Hello-World Application.

expo init FirstApp
cd FirstApp
expo start
```
### Step 3: Deploy a map on app
Develop the covid-19 app with a map. Install and set up React Native application with relative sources.
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
react-native run-ios
npm install --save react-native-map
```
### Step 4: On separate branch, exercise the CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) and display the data in your application as text.
This app can uses the CODVID-19 API to get the  number of confirmed cases by each state. Otherwise, It can also return the total number of confirmed cases per day in the whole country. The command is shown as below:
```
curl --location --request GET https://api.covid19api.com/live/country/united-states/status/confirmed/date/2020-04-10T20:00:00Z
curl --location --request GET https://api.covid19api.com/dayone/country/united-states/status/confirmed
